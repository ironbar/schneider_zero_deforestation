# Iteration 2. Fine-tune multiple models

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## 2.1 Goal

We are going to continue with the work from the previous iteration and fine-tune multiple different
architectures so we can later create an ensemble.

## 2.2 Development

Keras provides multiple pretrained models along with a function to preprocess the images. I can
extend the code that I had for ResNet50 to work with other architectures with minimal changes.
